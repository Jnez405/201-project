### Reflections and Comments


Working on the WWS website taught me a lot about managing and updating data dynamically and using Chart.js for visual representation. I tackled challenges like handling large data sets, ensuring data accuracy, and keeping the design consistent through efficient coding and teamwork. For future improvements, I plan to add features like data filtering and comparisons, use APIs for better data management, and enhance the visual elements for a better user experience.
